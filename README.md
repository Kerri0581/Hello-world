<h7>Interesting fact about me:</h7>
  <h8>I have had a story about me published in Take 5 Magazine in 2014, which is also published online for a health magazine in Dubai.</h8>
  
<h9>  Information Technology:</h9> 
<h10>I first became interested in IT when i was in year 10 at Balaklava High School in 1997. Myself and a fellow student were appointed as IT monitors for our newly built computer room. When the computer room was established we both had to set all the computers up, install all running programmes ready for students to use. As monitors of the computer room we were monitoring internet useage of the students ensuring that they were not researching prohibited things. We were also appointed as troublshooters for any issues a student may have had with their computer. We would help solve any issues that arose with the computer. I lost interest in IT when i moved away from home to study year 12 at another school. My rebellion started and my interest withered with it.</h10>
  <h11>I am now interested in IT and what it can do for the Financial Servies domain. The technological advances within the finance sector has changed the way we bank today. The introduction of apps on a smart phone for everything banking from Bpay for bills, to apple pay. Apple pay technology has allowed users to pay for goods or services at an EFTPOS machine with an application on thier phone that stores their bank card, allowing shoppers to hold thier phone near the EFTPOS machine to pay for goods. I am interested in safeguarding banking details to decline theft. WIFI technology on your phone is not totally failsafe, leaving loopholes for hackers to steal money from your bank account using WIFI.</h11> 
  <h12>I chose to study with RMIT because i am a mum working full time as a Maritime Security Guard, i have been working in the seurity sector for 13 years, i have always had an interest in finance and have chosen to follow my dream. RMIT online allows me to study when i want, where i want. 
  <h13> By studying introduction to IT i expect to learn what technolgy advances have been made within the finance industry and how better we can be more savvy to safeguarding personal information. I am particularly interested in cyber security as a whole and what we can do as individuals 
  
  
<h14>My ideal job is: A Senior Financial Advisor ...........
