Information Technology: I first became interested in IT when i was in year 10 at Balaklava High School in 1997. Myself and a fellow student designed a programme for teachers to do their student reports on. We had to install the programme on school computers and teach the teachers how to use it. I lost interest in IT when i moved away from home to study year 12 at another school. My rebellion started and my interest withered with it.
I am now interested in IT and what it can do for the Financial Servies domain.
