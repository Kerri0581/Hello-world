<h2>Interesting fact about me:</h2>
<p>I have had a story about me published in Take 5 Magazine in 2014, which is also published online for a health magazine in Dubai.</p>
  
<h2>  Information Technology:</h2> 
<p>I first became interested in IT when i was in year 10 at Balaklava High School in 1997. Myself and a fellow student were appointed as IT monitors for our newly built computer room. When the computer room was established we both had to set all the computers up, install all running programmes ready for students to use. As monitors of the computer room we were monitoring internet useage of the students ensuring that they were not researching prohibited things. We were also appointed as troublshooters for any issues a student may have had with their computer. We would help solve any issues that arose with the computer. I lost interest in IT when i moved away from home to study year 12 at another school. My rebellion started and my interest withered with it.</p>
<p>I am now interested in IT and what it can do for the Financial Servies domain. The technological advances within the finance sector has changed the way we bank today. The introduction of apps on a smart phone for everything banking from Bpay for bills, to apple pay. Apple pay technology has allowed users to pay for goods or services at an EFTPOS machine with an application on thier phone that stores their bank card, allowing shoppers to hold thier phone near the EFTPOS machine to pay for goods. I am interested in safeguarding banking details to decline theft. WIFI technology on your phone is not totally failsafe, leaving loopholes for hackers to steal money from your bank account using WIFI.</p> 
<p>I chose to study with RMIT because i am a mum working full time as a Maritime Security Guard, i have been working in the seurity sector for 13 years, i have always had an interest in finance and have chosen to follow my dream. RMIT online allows me to study when i want, where i want.</p> 
<p> By studying introduction to IT i expect to learn what technolgy advances have been made within the finance industry and how better we can be more savvy to safeguarding personal information. I am particularly interested in cyber security as a whole and what we can do as individuals

<h2> PERSONAL PROFILE </h2>

<h3>Online Learning Style.</h3>
<p> My results based on my online learning style is that i am an auditory learner. I have a high ability to remember what i hear and say. I really enjoy a classroom environment where i can take part in small group discussions to cement my learning. I am able to remember instructions well and am able to perfect my understanding better when i carry out a given task. 
  <p> I find it easier to understand things when i can study with a friend and discuss what i have learnt. When reading i tend to skip through the main content however i take not of pictures, bullet points and chapter titles then read out loud what i think it is about. I regularly make flash cards for various materials i have learnt and read them out loud repeatedly. I prefer to discuss ideas i do not totally understand to deepen my understanding. I am very easily distracted from the task at hand and hate loud noises around me while trying to study. </p>
  <h3> Myers Briggs Personality Test </h3>
  <p> Based on the results of the Myers Briggs Personality test i am an Advocate. I have a sense of idealism and morality and am capable of taking concrete steps to realise my goals and make a positive and lasting impact. I love helping people but i also thrive on making people realise that they don't need my help either. I teach them to be confident in their abilities and knowledge enough to not need me to help them at all.
  <h4> Strengths </h4>
  <p> I have a vivid imagination and a very strong sense of compassion. I find it dificult to solve technical issues but love finding the perfect solution for my loved ones. I can see through dishonesty and alterior motives because of this i prefer to get into a honest discussion quickly to get to the heart of something. </p>
  <p> I am inspring yet convincing. My writing style is fluid and inspirational, instantly appealing to the inner idealist. I find that when i am proud of what i am speaking or writing about i can get my point accross easily with passion, however if my passion for the suject is decreased i tend to lose interest quickly and become distracted. </p>
  <p> I am very decisive, i follow through on my ideas with conviction, willpower and necessary planning to see things through to the end. Rather than seeing things as they i would like them to be i act on them to make them a reality. </p>
<p> I am determined and passionate, when i see something as important i pursue it with convction that even suprises those around me. I will rock the boat if i have to to achieve what i want, much to the dislike of many, but my passion for my cause is not seen by everyone, even those close to me. </p> 
<h4> Weaknesses</h4>
<p>I am highly vulnerable to criticism, questioning my motives will get you on my bad side very quickly. 
I am extremely private when it comes to my personal life, i do this to avoid truly opening up to someone. It takes me a while to trust new friends and even longer to gain back trust when it it broken for any reason. </p>
<p> I am very perfectionistic, my pursuit for the ideal even in situations where it is not always possible such as business and romance. I too easily drop and ignore healthy relationships believing that i deserve more and that there are better ones down the road. I will not settle for less than perfect and resent people that try to get in my way of achieving perfection in all that i do ( particularly so at exam time eek?? </p>
<p> I always need to have a cause - i get so caught up in the passion of my pursuit that any othe cumbersome maintenance work that comes in between that is seen as cumbersome. Even personal maintenance of myself such as family time or social time, i find that when i am away from a task that is not aimed at pursuing my dream i am not fully satisfied, i am always thinking that i need to get back to studying. As a chronic pain sufferer it is this cause that not only keeps me distracted from the pain but also keeps me going, feeling like i am achieving something. This even raised by my pain psychologist asking if i need to always achieve something to feel worthy - my response was "yes" </p> 
  <p> I burn out very easily - My passion and poor patience for routine maintenance, and tendency to prove myself as ideal tend to leave me with minimal options to let off steam. Finding me likely to exhaust myself in short order if i don't find a way to balance my ideeals with day to day living. </p>
  
<h3> Big Five Personality Test </h3>
<h4> Openness - 62.5% </h4>
<p> According to the Big Five Personality test; People who get high scores for openness are typically adventurous, creative and intellectual. Whilst low scorers tend to be practical, conventional and focused. Depending on the parameter of interest for this test its hard to know where i sit on this scale. </p>

<h4> Conscientiousness - 85% </h4>
<p> This is a person ability to exercise self disccipline. As a security officer this result does not surprise me. High scorers are organised and determined, with the ability to forego short term gratification for the sake of long-term achievement. </P>

<h4> Extraversion - 73% </h4>
<p> I find myself as someone that is very outgoing and confident, which could explain a high score in this area. As a socialite i am very confident and seek approval from all around me. However on the same token their approval is not important to me, i am a person that thinks if someone does not like me or approve of me or what im doing it is thier problem not mine.</p>

<h4> Agreeableness - 81% </h4>
<p>I am often a person to put others needs before my own, my compassion for others is quite high due to lifetime stresses i have endured. I love to take care of others i feel like it gives me a sense of belonging, pride and comfort. </p>

<h4> Neuroticism - 40% </h4>
<p>I have scored low in this area, i used to be a person to let others emotions bring me down or ignite fear or sadness. Now i am a person that does not let things bother me as much, any misfortune i come up against now i am able to brush off and move on. </p>

<h3> What do these results mean to me? </h3> 
<p>They have given me a sense of completeness knowing that i am on the right track to success. I am on my ideal path in life now and these results have just confirmed that. Finding out my online learning style test has given me ways on which i could make my study experience a successful one, the results confirmed what i knew already but knowing how i can improve my learning experience is something i did not know. </p>
<h3> How do you think these results would influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
<p>The knowlegde of these results will influence me in a positive way for a team exercise. Rather than finding the need to do more i will rely more on my team to produce a joint effort. I endeavour to learn more trust in my team mates with knowledge that they are driving for the same level of perfection with the drive to achieve high distinctions, like myself. I am typically a person that likes to take charge when i am confident in my knowledge and abilities. IT is a weak area for me so i will take more direction from other team members and ask more questions to further cement my understanding. With techniques on how to improve my learning style i will do more actvities that suit my learning style, such as group discussions.</p> 
<h3> How should you take this into account when forming a team? <h3>
 <p>I will look to engage with other students that share a drive for perfection and high scores. With feeling like a student with limited IT exposure and experience i will be looking for others that have vast knowledge so that i can learn from them to improve my confidence. I will search for people that are not scared to take a leadership role and will use my conscientiousness to find others who are also seeking long-term achievement and drive.</p>
