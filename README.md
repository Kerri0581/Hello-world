<h8>Information Technology:</h8> 
<h9>I first became interested in IT when i was in year 10 at Balaklava High School in 1997. Myself and a fellow student designed a programme for teachers to do their student reports on. We had to install the programme on school computers and teach the teachers how to use it. I lost interest in IT when i moved away from home to study year 12 at another school. My rebellion started and my interest withered with it.</h9>
<h10>I am now interested in IT and what it can do for the Financial Servies domain. I am studying a Bahelor of Business ( Financial Planning ) at the moment and want to learn more about cyber security for the Finance industry. I am interested in how to safeguard peoples financial details on the internet.</h10>
